            <h2>The Complexities of Modern Parenting</h2>
            <p>Parenting today involves juggling work, responsibilities, and emotional care — often with limited time. Children need attention, guidance, and emotional support, especially during key developmental years. But parents can’t always be present every moment of the day.</p>

            <div class="conflict-type">
                <h3>Everyday Family Struggles</h3>
                <p>Common parenting challenges include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Balancing work and quality time with children</li>
                    <li>Helping children express emotions in healthy ways</li>
                    <li>Managing screen time and finding safe, educational alternatives</li>
                    <li>Understanding early signs of stress, anxiety, or loneliness in kids</li>
                    <li>Creating meaningful parent-child conversations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These issues can lead to stress and communication gaps between parents and children.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Emotional Support for Children Matters</h2>
            <p>Children thrive when they feel safe, understood, and emotionally supported. But when they're left alone or misunderstood, they may become withdrawn, anxious, or frustrated.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early emotional development</strong> shapes future confidence and relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Open communication</strong> helps kids express themselves and feel heard</li>
                <li><strong>Positive daily interactions</strong> build trust and emotional security</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How HarmonyBot’s Childcare Robots Help</h2>
            <p>Our robots, like <strong>Timi</strong>, are designed to support families by acting as smart, friendly companions for children — especially when parents are busy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conversational Companionship:</strong> Timi talks with children naturally, keeping them engaged and emotionally supported</li>
                <li><strong>Emotion Recognition:</strong> Timi understands tone and mood to respond with care and help parents stay informed</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Through Play:</strong> Storytelling, songs, games, and simple lessons keep children entertained and mentally active</li>
                <li><strong>Parental Insight:</strong> Parents can access conversation history and gentle alerts when a child seems sad or anxious</li>
                <li><strong>Safe and Private:</strong> Designed with child safety and privacy in mind, with full control for caregivers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By filling in the emotional and interactive gaps when parents are busy, HarmonyBot helps create a warmer, more connected family environment — where children feel supported, and parents feel more confident.</p>
