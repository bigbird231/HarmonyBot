                <h2>The Complexity of Human Relationships</h2>
                <p>Human relationships are intricate webs of emotions, expectations, communication patterns, and personal histories. When these elements clash, conflicts arise that can be challenging to resolve without outside assistance.</p>
                
                <div class="conflict-type">
                    <h3>Romantic Relationships</h3>
                    <p>Romantic partnerships are among the most emotionally charged relationships we experience. Conflicts in these relationships often stem from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communication breakdowns</li>
                        <li>Differing expectations about the relationship</li>
                        <li>Financial disagreements</li>
                        <li>Intimacy issues</li>
                        <li>Work-life balance challenges</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These conflicts are particularly difficult to resolve because both parties are emotionally invested and may struggle to see the situation objectively.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="conflict-type">
                    <h3>Family Dynamics</h3>
                    <p>Family relationships carry the weight of long histories and deeply ingrained patterns. Common family conflicts include:</p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The complexity of family systems makes these conflicts particularly challenging, as they often involve multiple relationships simultaneously.</p>
