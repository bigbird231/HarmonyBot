                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>HarmonyBot was founded in 2023 with a simple but powerful mission: to help people build stronger, healthier relationships through innovative technology.</p>
                <p>Our founders, experts in AI and relationship psychology, recognized that while technology often gets blamed for creating distance between people, it also has the potential to bring them closer together when designed with human connection in mind.</p>
                <p>After years of research and development, we created HarmonyBot â€“ an AI-powered robot specifically designed to help resolve conflicts and improve communication in all types of relationships.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>At HarmonyBot, we believe that healthy relationships are the foundation of a fulfilling life. Our mission is to make relationship support accessible to everyone, helping to create a world where conflicts are resolved constructively and connections are strengthened rather than broken.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Values</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> We design with deep understanding of human emotions and needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We continuously push the boundaries of what AI can do to support human connection</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> We respect the sensitive nature of relationship discussions and prioritize data security</li>
                    <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> We create technology that serves diverse relationships and communication styles</li>
                    <li><strong>Evidence-based:</strong> Our approaches are grounded in relationship science and psychology research</li>
